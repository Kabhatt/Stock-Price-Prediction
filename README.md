# WHAT IS THE STOCK MARKET? 

# Stock Market Overview

A stock market is a public market where you can buy and sell shares for a publicly listed company. Stocks represent ownership in a company and are traded on stock exchanges.

## Stock Exchanges

A **stock exchange** is an organized marketplace where securities, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, are bought and sold. It provides a platform for investors to trade securities.

### Amsterdam Stock Exchange

The **Amsterdam Stock Exchange** is the oldest stock exchange in the world, established in 1602. It played a crucial role in the development of the modern stock market.

### Top Stock Exchanges in the US

The United States has several major stock exchanges, including:

- **NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)**
- **NASDAQ**
- **US Stock Exchange**
- **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)**

These exchanges facilitate the trading of a wide range of securities and play a significant role in the global financial markets.

# The Importance of the Stock Market

The stock market plays a crucial role in the economy and financial markets, serving various purposes:

## 1. Capital Raising
The stock market provides companies with a platform to raise capital by issuing stocks to investors. This capital can be used for business expansion, research and development, and other strategic initiatives.

## 2. Wealth Creation
Investing in the stock market offers individuals the opportunity to grow their wealth over time. By purchasing stocks, investors can benefit from capital appreciation and dividends, potentially increasing their net worth.

## 3. Economic Indicator
The performance of the stock market often serves as an indicator of the overall state of the economy. Bullish trends may signal economic growth, while bearish trends may indicate economic downturns.

## 4. Investment Growth
Participation in the stock market allows individuals and institutions to allocate funds for long-term investment growth. By investing in stocks, investors can potentially earn higher returns compared to other asset classes over time.

Overall, the stock market is a vital component of the financial system, contributing to economic growth, wealth creation, and investment opportunities.

# Stock Market Prediction
* **Future Value Prediction**
  - The stock market helps us assess the future value of a company's stock and other financial instruments traded on an exchange.
* **Profit Prediction**
  - The primary goal is to predict significant profits through stock trading and investment.
* **Factors Affecting Predictions**
  - Various factors influence stock price predictions, including:
    * Physical and psychological factors
    * Rational and irrational behaviors
    * Thought processes
    * Bias
* **Dynamic Nature of Share Prices**
  - Share prices are dynamic and volatile due to these factors, making it challenging to predict stock prices with high accuracy.

* We will choose two stocks of our liking and gather data related to their previous performance.
* The companies I will be choosing are: 
  * OCGN 
  * AMC
  * Google (possibly)
* We will use the Linear Regression Algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to build prediction models for each.

<div style="color:teal; font-size:16pt; text-decoration: underline;">Basics of Linear Regression.</div>
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm to predict the outcome of a continuous variable. It's a statistical tool used for solving Machine Learning Problems. It can be used to predict the total revenue of the company or the total units expected to be sold of a certain product
